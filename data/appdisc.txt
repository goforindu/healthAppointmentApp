Home Page:

The home page features a search bar at the top, 
allowing users to search for doctors based on
 their name, specialty, or location.

Below the search bar, there is a list of doctors displayed in a 
scrollable format.

Each doctor is represented by a card or tile, 
showcasing their profile picture, name, specialty, 
and a button to view their availability.

Users can click on the "View Availability" button to proceed to the doctor's availability page.
Doctor's Availability Page:

The doctor's availability page displays the selected 
doctor's profile picture, name, and specialty at the top.

The availability is presented in a visual timeline format,
 divided into time slots (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening).

Each time slot is represented as a clickable element or button.

Booked time slots are marked as unavailable or grayed out,
 while available time slots are highlighted or 
 displayed with a different color.
Users can click on an available time slot to proceed
 to the appointment confirmation page.

Appointment Confirmation Page:

The appointment confirmation page shows the selected doctor's details 
(name, specialty) at the top.
Below that, there is a section where users can review their 
chosen time slot, along with the date and time.
The page also includes 
a form or input fields for the user to provide their 
name, contact information,
 and any additional notes or reasons for the appointment.

A "Confirm Appointment" button is displayed at 
the bottom of the page, which users 
can click to finalize the appointment.
